          <h2>Our Story: From Idea to Action</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to Ecobuddi, where we believe in the power of
            transformation. Our journey began with a simple yet profound idea -
            to turn clutter into cash, and in the process, change the way
            students interact with their unwanted belongings and the
            environment.{" "}
          </p>
          <h2>The Birth of Ecobuddi</h2>
          <p>
            In the midst of brainstorming sessions and countless cups of coffee,
            the Ecobuddi concept was born. We asked ourselves, "What if we could
            create a marketplace that not only helped students declutter their
            lives but also put money in their pockets?" That spark of
            inspiration fueled our commitment to make it a reality.
          </p>
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            We're not just a marketplace; we're a community that believes in the
            potential of every item, the value of sustainability, and the
            importance of student empowerment
          </p>
